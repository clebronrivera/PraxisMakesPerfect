## Recommendations Summary

### ✅ USE EXISTING (23 questions)
Most questions map correctly to existing skills. No changes needed.

### ⚠️ EXPAND EXISTING (6 questions)

1. **Q004 - NEW-10-RecordKeeping**: Add medical record access concept
2. **Q009 - NEW-4-Psychopathology**: Add social influences assessment
3. **Q016 - DBDM-S01**: Add reliability definition (consistency/stability)
4. **Q024 - MBH-S05**: Add EBP recognition aspect
5. **Q026 - DBDM-S03**: Add cognitive construct identification (working memory)
6. **Q027 - LEG-S02**: Add IEP content requirements

### ❌ CREATE NEW SKILL (1 question)

**Q028 - LEG-S07: Informed Consent Requirements**
- **Decision Rule**: "Ensure student safety first, then inform that parental consent required for ongoing counseling. Cannot provide ongoing counseling without parental consent, even if student requests confidentiality."
- **Justification**: This is a distinct ethical/legal requirement not covered by existing confidentiality or ethics skills. It specifically addresses the balance between student autonomy and parental consent requirements.

---

## Proposed New Skill

### LEG-S07: Informed Consent Requirements

**Decision Rule**: 
- Ensure student safety first when student requests counseling
- Inform student that parental consent is required for ongoing counseling
- Cannot provide ongoing counseling services without parental consent, regardless of student age or request for confidentiality
- Distinguish between brief safety check (allowed) and ongoing counseling (requires consent)

**Common Wrong Rules**:
- Providing ongoing counseling without parental consent because student is in high school
- Denying any contact with student without first ensuring safety
- Automatically informing parents without first assessing student safety
- Believing student age eliminates need for parental consent

**Required Evidence**: Question must present scenario where student requests counseling with condition of no parent notification

**Boundary Conditions**: Applies to informed consent questions. Does not apply to confidentiality breach questions (different context).

**Domain**: 10 (Legal/Ethics)
**Cluster**: LEG-B (Ethics & Confidentiality)

## No New Clusters Needed

All questions fit within existing clusters. No need for new skill clusters.
