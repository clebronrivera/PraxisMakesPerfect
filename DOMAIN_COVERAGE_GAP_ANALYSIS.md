## Recommendations

1. **Resolve mapping discrepancies** - Standardize on a single source of truth for question-to-skill mappings
2. **Prioritize high-priority gaps** - Focus on generating questions for topics with 0 coverage
3. **Strengthen partial coverage** - Add questions to topics with only 1-2 questions
4. **Review out-of-scope questions** - Determine if these questions should be remapped or removed
5. **Create skill mappings** - For uncovered topics, consider creating new skills or expanding existing ones
