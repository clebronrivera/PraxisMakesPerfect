## Analysis & Recommendations

### Scope Assessment

**🚨 SYSTEMIC ISSUE**: Problems are widespread across many templates and domains.

**Recommendation**: Refactor the distractor generation logic globally.

### Specific Actions

1. **Fix Irrelevant Domain Terms** (54 issues)
   - SP5403_Q007: RTI (intervention) in LEG-S02
   - SP5403_Q011: Mills (legal) in MBH-S02
   - SP5403_Q011: Larry P. (legal) in MBH-S02
   - SP5403_Q011: Lau (legal) in MBH-S02
   - SP5403_Q012: RTI (intervention) in CC-S03

2. **Add Length Validation** (60 issues)
   - Implement length check in distractor generator
   - Target: distractors should be 50-200% of correct answer length
