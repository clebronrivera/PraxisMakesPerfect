    "question": "A school psychologist is working with a group of third-grade students who struggle with peer interactions. The students have difficulty taking turns, sharing materials, and initiating conversations. Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate for addressing these social skill deficits?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Providing individual counseling sessions focusing on emotional regulation",
      "B": "Recommending small-group social skills training",
      "C": "Using only direct instruction about social rules without practice",
      "D": "Believing social skills will develop naturally without intervention"
    },
    "correct_answer": ["B"],
    "rationale": "Option (B) is correct. Small-group social skills training provides opportunities for modeling, rehearsal, and feedback, which are essential components of effective social skills instruction. The group setting allows students to practice skills with peers in a structured environment.",

    "question": "A school psychologist is conducting a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) for a student who engages in disruptive behavior. During the observation phase, the psychologist is systematically recording data. Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of documenting behavior during the FBA process?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "To document the frequency and severity of a student's problem behaviors",
      "B": "To identify the function of the behavior through analysis of antecedents and consequences",
      "C": "To determine whether a student qualifies for special education services",
      "D": "To identify the consequences that will be applied when a student misbehaves"
    },
    "correct_answer": ["A"],
    "rationale": "Option (A) is correct. During the FBA observation phase, the primary purpose is to document the frequency, severity, and patterns of behavior.

    "question": "A school psychologist observes that a student consistently interrupts the teacher during whole-group instruction. When the student interrupts, the teacher stops the lesson, looks directly at the student, and asks what they need. The student then smiles and appears satisfied. After this interaction, the student continues to interrupt throughout the lesson. Based on this observation, which of the following is the most likely function of this behavior?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Escape or avoidance",
      "B": "Attention seeking",
      "C": "Sensory stimulation",
      "D": "Tangible reinforcement"
    },
    "correct_answer": ["B"],
    "rationale": "Option (B) is correct. The behavior is maintained by attention from the teacher. The student interrupts, receives direct attention (teacher stops, looks, and asks), appears satisfied, and then repeats the behavior. This pattern indicates the behavior functions to obtain attention, as the consequence (teacher attention) is what maintains the behavior.",

    "question": "A school psychologist is conducting a Functional Behavior Assessment for a student who frequently engages in hand-flapping and finger-flicking behaviors. Observations indicate these behaviors occur consistently throughout the day, regardless of the presence of others, the type of task, or access to preferred items. The behaviors appear to increase when the student appears stressed but also occur during calm, preferred activities. Which of the following is the most likely function of this behavior?",
    "choices": {

      "B": "Escape or avoidance",
      "C": "Sensory stimulation",
      "D": "Tangible reinforcement"

    "correct_answer": ["C"],
    "rationale": "Option (C) is correct. The behavior occurs regardless of social context, task demands, or access to items, and appears to provide internal stimulation. Hand-flapping and finger-flicking are self-stimulatory behaviors that function to provide sensory stimulation, as they occur independently of external consequences and appear to be automatically reinforcing.",

    "question": "A school psychologist is working with a student who experiences test anxiety. The student's teacher approaches the psychologist and requests that the student receive extended time on all assessments, stating that this accommodation has worked well for other students with anxiety. The psychologist has not yet assessed this specific student's needs or reviewed data about how the accommodation might impact this student. In this situation, which of the following would be the most appropriate initial response?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Gather data to determine whether extended time is an appropriate accommodation for this specific student",
      "B": "Automatically approve the extended time request since the teacher made the request",

      "D": "Recommend extended time for all students in the class to ensure fairness"
    },
    "correct_answer": ["A"],
    "rationale": "Option (A) is correct. School psychologists should base accommodation and intervention decisions on data and individual student assessment, not automatically approve requests without evaluation. This aligns with data-based decision making and ensures accommodations are matched to specific student needs rather than applied automatically based on requests alone. While the teacher's input is valuable, the psychologist must gather data to determine the appropriateness of the accommodation for this particular student.",

    "question": "A school psychologist receives a report that a high school student has made a specific threat of violence toward other students, has access to means, and has expressed clear intent. The student is currently in the building and appears agitated. The school psychologist has assessed the immediate risk and determined the student poses an imminent danger. Which of the following should the school psychologist do first?",

    },
    "correct_answer": ["C"],
    "rationale": "Option (C) is correct. When a student poses an imminent danger with a specific threat, means, and intent, the school psychologist's crisis response role requires immediately contacting external crisis resources or emergency services. This ensures the safety of all students and connects the student to appropriate crisis intervention services. The psychologist's role during crisis is to provide immediate support, triage, and connect to resources, not to provide counseling or delay action.",

      "A": "Using the same drill script and procedures for all grade levels",

      "D": "Mixing all ages together to simulate real emergency conditions"
    },
    "correct_answer": ["B"],
    "rationale": "Option (B) is correct. Crisis drills should be developmentally appropriate, and grouping students at similar developmental levels ensures that instructions, expectations, and procedures can be tailored appropriately. Younger students need simpler, more concrete instructions, while older students can handle more complex procedures. This approach prevents traumatizing younger students while ensuring all students are prepared appropriately for their developmental level.",
