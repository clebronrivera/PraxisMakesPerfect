## Proposed NEW SKILLS

### LEG-S07: Informed Consent Requirements

**Skill ID**: `LEG-S07`  
**Name**: Informed Consent Requirements  
**Domain**: 10 (Legal/Ethics)  
**Cluster**: LEG-B (Ethics & Confidentiality)

**Decision Rule**: 
- Ensure student safety first when student requests counseling
- Inform student that parental consent is required for ongoing counseling
- Cannot provide ongoing counseling services without parental consent, regardless of student age or request for confidentiality
- Distinguish between brief safety check (allowed) and ongoing counseling (requires consent)

**Questions That Test This Skill**:
- ETS_Q028

**Justification**: 
This is a distinct ethical/legal requirement not covered by existing confidentiality (LEG-S03) or general ethics (LEG-S06) skills. It specifically addresses the balance between student autonomy and parental consent requirements for ongoing counseling services. The decision rule is fundamentally different: it's about consent requirements, not confidentiality breaches.

**Common Wrong Rules**:
- Providing ongoing counseling without parental consent because student is in high school
- Denying any contact with student without first ensuring safety
- Automatically informing parents without first assessing student safety
- Believing student age eliminates need for parental consent

**Required Evidence**: Question must present scenario where student requests counseling with condition of no parent notification

**Boundary Conditions**: Applies to informed consent questions. Does not apply to confidentiality breach questions (different context).

## EXPANDED SKILLS

### 1. NEW-10-RecordKeeping (Q004)

**Current Decision Rule**: "Correct answer upholds parent rights to access unless specific legal revocation exists."

**New Concepts to Add**:
- Medical records with parent authorization appropriate when health issues may affect student learning or behavior
- Requesting medical records is appropriate when:
  - Student reports symptoms not clearly related to health condition
  - Student receives medication during school day that may affect learning/behavior

**Questions Revealing This**: ETS_Q004

**Expansion Note**: Adds concept of WHEN to request medical records (different from parent access rights)

---

### 2. NEW-4-Psychopathology (Q009)

**Current Decision Rule**: "Correct answer requires knowledge of DSM-5 criteria or developmental variations (e.g., irritability in child depression)."

**New Concepts to Add**:
- Social influences on mental health development include: peer relationships, reactions to success and failure, protective factors
- Assessment of social influences requires interviewing about peer relationships and reactions to life events

**Questions Revealing This**: ETS_Q009

**Expansion Note**: Adds assessment of social/environmental factors (beyond diagnostic criteria)

---

### 3. DBDM-S01 (Q016)

**Current Decision Rule**: "Match reliability type to measurement context. Single-subject/behavioral observation requires interobserver agreement. Consistent scores over time requires test-retest. Internal scale consistency requires Cronbach's alpha."

**New Concepts to Add**:
- Reliability = consistency or stability in measurement
- Low reliability = scores vary across administrations
- Test-retest reliability specifically measures stability over time

**Questions Revealing This**: ETS_Q016

**Expansion Note**: Adds reliability definition/concept (beyond type selection)

---

### 4. MBH-S05 (Q024)

**Current Decision Rule**: "CBT = identify and challenge cognitive distortions. SFBT = miracle question, solution-focused. DBT = mindfulness, emotion regulation."

**New Concepts to Add**:
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice (EBP) for treating internalizing problems (depression, anxiety)
- EBP recognition requires knowing which interventions have empirical support

**Questions Revealing This**: ETS_Q024

**Expansion Note**: Adds EBP recognition aspect (broader than just technique identification)

---

### 5. DBDM-S03 (Q026)

**Current Decision Rule**: "Confidence intervals show range where true score likely falls. Reliability coefficients (.90+ excellent, .80+ good) indicate consistency. SEM quantifies measurement error. Standard scores (mean=100, SD=15) show relative standing. Percentile rank = percentage of scores equal to or lower. Z-score = (score - mean) / SD."

**New Concepts to Add**:
- Working memory = cognitive ability to attend to information, hold information in immediate awareness, and perform mental operations
- Cognitive construct identification requires recognizing which ability is being measured

**Questions Revealing This**: ETS_Q026

**Expansion Note**: Adds cognitive construct identification (beyond score interpretation)

---

### 6. LEG-S02 (Q027)

**Current Decision Rule**: "IDEA = FAPE, zero-reject principle, procedural safeguards, electronic communication allowed, IEP requirements, interagency collaboration for transitions."

**New Concepts to Add**:
- IEP content includes: specialized instruction based on student needs, related services (e.g., counseling, social work) when needed, modifications/accommodations
- IEP services determined by evaluation results and student needs

**Questions Revealing This**: ETS_Q027

**Expansion Note**: Adds specific IEP content requirements (beyond general IDEA requirements)

---

## New Clusters

**None Required** - All questions fit within existing skill clusters. No new clusters needed.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add LEG-S07** to `src/brain/skill-map.ts` under Domain 10, Cluster LEG-B
2. **Expand 6 existing skills** with new concepts as detailed above
3. **Update question-skill-map.json** with confirmed mappings
4. **Create template** for LEG-S07 in domain-10-templates.ts (if templates exist)
5. **Update skill decision rules** in skill-map.ts with expanded concepts
