Question 66
================================================================================

ID: SP5403_Q141
Skill ID: NEW-10-EthicalProblemSolving
Skill Name: Ethical Problem-Solving Model

Question:
A school psychologist faces an ethical dilemma involving competing principles. According to NASP's ethical problem-solving model, what is the first step the psychologist should take?

Choices:
  A. Identify the ethical principles in conflict ✓ CORRECT
  B. Consult with a colleague or supervisor
  C. Determine the best course of action
  D. Document the decision-making process

Rationale:
Option (A) is correct. The ethical problem-solving model begins with identifying and clarifying the ethical principles in conflict (e.g., confidentiality vs. safety, autonomy vs. beneficence). Only after identifying the conflict can the psychologist proceed to consider options, consult, and make a decision.

ID: SP5403_Q142
Skill ID: NEW-10-EthicalProblemSolving
Skill Name: Ethical Problem-Solving Model

Question:
A student tells a school psychologist in confidence that they are planning to harm a classmate. The psychologist must balance confidentiality with the duty to protect. Which ethical principle takes precedence in this situation?

Choices:
  A. Confidentiality, because the student trusted the psychologist
  B. Duty to protect, because there is an imminent threat to others ✓ CORRECT
  C. Autonomy, because the student has the right to privacy
  D. Beneficence, because the psychologist should help the student

Rationale:
Option (B) is correct. When there is an imminent threat to others, the duty to protect (derived from Tarasoff and ethical principles) takes precedence over confidentiality. The psychologist must warn the intended victim and/or take steps to prevent harm, even if it means breaching confidentiality.

Skill ID: NEW-10-EthicalProblemSolving
Skill Name: Ethical Problem-Solving Model

Question:
A school psychologist notices that a school administrator is pressuring teachers to delay special education referrals to reduce costs, which violates IDEA requirements. According to NASP ethical principles, what should the psychologist do first?

Choices:
  A. Ignore the situation, as it is not the psychologist's responsibility
  B. Address the concern directly with the administrator and document the conversation ✓ CORRECT
  C. Report the administrator to the state education department immediately
  D. Discuss the situation only with other psychologists

Rationale:
Option (B) is correct. NASP ethical principles require school psychologists to address unethical behavior directly when possible, beginning with the person involved. The psychologist should discuss the concern with the administrator, explain why the practice violates IDEA, and document the conversation. If the behavior continues, then escalation to higher authorities or state departments may be necessary.

Question:
A school psychologist's close friend asks the psychologist to evaluate their child for special education services. The psychologist should:

Choices:
  A. Proceed with the evaluation since they know the family well
  B. Decline the evaluation and refer to another qualified professional ✓ CORRECT
  C. Conduct the evaluation but charge a reduced fee
  D. Proceed only if the friend signs a waiver

Rationale:
Option (B) is correct. Dual relationships create conflicts of interest that can impair objectivity and professional judgment. When a personal relationship exists, the psychologist should decline the professional service and refer to another qualified professional to avoid compromising the evaluation's objectivity and validity.

Question:
A school psychologist is asked to conduct a neuropsychological evaluation, which requires specialized training the psychologist does not have. The most ethical response is to:

Choices:
  A. Attempt the evaluation using general assessment knowledge
  B. Decline and refer to a qualified neuropsychologist ✓ CORRECT
  C. Conduct a basic evaluation and note limitations in the report
  D. Accept but request additional time to learn the procedures

Rationale:
Option (B) is correct. School psychologists must practice within their scope of competence. When a service requires specialized training or expertise the psychologist does not possess, they must decline and refer to a qualified professional. Attempting services outside one's competence violates ethical principles and can harm students.

Question:
A classroom teacher wants to refer a student for evaluation for a learning disability. The student emigrated to the United States two and a half years ago, quickly learned English, and can communicate fluently with all the children in the classroom. However, the student continues to have difficulty with schoolwork, frequently asks for directions to be repeated, and demonstrates poor comprehension based on written work. To help the teacher understand the student's difficulty, it is most important that the school psychologist explain which of the following?

Choices:

  B. The difference between basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) and cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP) ✓ CORRECT
  C. The Culture-Language Interpretive Matrix (C-LIM)
  D. The cultural and linguistic biases that are present in testing

Rationale:
Basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) are developed before cognitive language academic proficiency (CALP). It typically takes learners from six months to two years to develop BICS, while CALP can take five to seven years to develop.

Question:
A school psychologist is consulting with a teacher who reports that a student frequently engages in attention-seeking behavior. Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate?

Choices:
  A. Ignoring all of the student's behavior
  B. Providing attention for appropriate behavior and minimizing attention for inappropriate behavior ✓ CORRECT

Question:
A student has a medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity but does not require specialized instruction. Under which law would this student most likely be eligible for services?

Choices:
  A. IDEA, because it covers all disabilities
  B. Section 504, because it covers students who need accommodations but not specialized instruction ✓ CORRECT
  C. Both IDEA and Section 504 equally
  D. Neither, because specialized instruction is required

Rationale:
Option (B) is correct. Section 504 covers students with disabilities who need accommodations and modifications to access education but do not require specialized instruction. IDEA requires that the disability adversely affects educational performance AND requires specialized instruction. A student who only needs accommodations (not specialized instruction) would be eligible under Section 504, not IDEA.

  B. IDEA provides specialized instruction and related services; Section 504 provides accommodations and modifications for access ✓ CORRECT
  C. There is no difference in services provided
  D. IDEA is for physical disabilities; Section 504 is for learning disabilities

Rationale:
Option (B) is correct. IDEA provides specialized instruction (specially designed instruction) and related services based on an IEP. Section 504 provides accommodations and modifications to ensure equal access to education. IDEA focuses on educational benefit through specialized instruction, while Section 504 focuses on access through accommodations.

  B. Section 504 requires more comprehensive evaluation than IDEA
  C. Both require identical evaluation procedures
  D. Neither requires formal evaluation

Rationale:
Option (A) is correct. IDEA requires a comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team using multiple assessment tools and sources. Section 504 requires evaluation by a team of knowledgeable persons, but the evaluation can be less comprehensive. IDEA has more specific procedural requirements for evaluation than Section 504.
