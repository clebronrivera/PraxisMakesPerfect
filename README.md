# PraxisMakesPerfect

PraxisMakesPerfect is a React + Vite study platform for the Praxis School Psychologist exam. The current app uses a taxonomy-driven question bank, Supabase-backed authentication and progress storage, adaptive practice flows, assessment builders, and question-generation tooling.

Historical and superseded documentation has been moved under `archive/`.
Historical Firebase setup and Firestore operations docs now live under `archive/docs-legacy-2026-03-18/`.

## Current Source-Of-Truth Rules

- Praxis content areas are the primary assessment and reporting structure.
- Domains and skills are taxonomy-derived; they are not inferred from question text.
- `skillId` is required for question classification and downstream analytics.
- Supabase is the active persistence layer for authentication, profile data, and response events.
- If documentation conflicts with code, current code and the canonical docs win.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

Build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run scan:types
npm run scan:knip
npm run scan:cycles
npm run diagnostics
npm run audit:bank
npm run audit:distractors
npm run audit:answers
npm run verify:health
```

## Runtime Overview

- Frontend: React 18 + Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Persistence: Supabase Auth + Supabase Postgres
- Question bank: `src/data/questions.json`
- Skill taxonomy: `src/brain/skill-map.ts`
- Assessment builder: `src/utils/assessment-builder.ts`
- Assessment and adaptive logic: `src/brain/*`, `src/hooks/*`, `src/components/*`

## Notes

- Older quick-start, implementation-plan, and audit files are retained only as historical artifacts under `archive/`.
- Root-level planning and audit sprawl is no longer authoritative unless it is listed above.
- `local/` is the intentionally ignored workspace for private PDFs, DOCX deliverables, scratch mapping files, and other local-only materials that should not land on GitHub.
- Generated CSV/JSON exports under `output/` are local working artifacts by default, not canonical tracked assets; the current explicit tracked exception is `output/AUDIT_SUMMARY.md`.
